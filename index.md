## About me 

I'm a Machine Learning and NLP PhD student at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. I'm also a researcher at Instituto de Telecomunicações. My advisors are [Prof. André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/) and [Prof. Zita Marinho](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zmarinho/).

I'm very enthusiastic about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, being my main research interests Natural Language Generation and Deep Latent Variable Models.
